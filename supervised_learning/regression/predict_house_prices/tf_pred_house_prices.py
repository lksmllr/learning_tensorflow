# The Boston Housing Prices dataset
# This dataset is accessible directly in TensorFlow. Download and shuffle the training set:

boston_housing = keras.datasets.boston_housing

(train_data, train_labels), (test_data, test_labels) = boston_housing.load_data()

# Shuffle the training set
order = np.argsort(np.random.random(train_labels.shape))

# Examples and features

print("Training set: {}".format(train_data.shape))  # 404 examples, 13 features
print("Testing set:  {}".format(test_data.shape))   # 102 examples, 13 features

"""
The dataset contains 13 different features:

1. Per capita crime rate.
2. The proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 square feet.
3. The proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
4. Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).
5. Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
6 .The average number of rooms per dwelling.
7. The proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940.
8. Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers.
9. Index of accessibility to radial highways.
10. Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000.
11. Pupil-teacher ratio by town.
12. 1000 * (Bk - 0.63) ** 2 where Bk is the proportion of Black people by town.
13. Percentage lower status of the population.

Each one of these input data features is stored using a different scale. 
Some features are represented by a proportion between 0 and 1, other features are 
ranges between 1 and 12, some are ranges between 0 and 100, and so on. This is often 
the case with real-world data, and understanding how to explore and clean such data is 
an important skill to develop.

# It's recommended to normalize features that use different scales and ranges.
